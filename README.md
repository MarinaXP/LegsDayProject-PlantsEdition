# LegsDayProject-PlantsEdition
_You can't soak up the sun by just rooting around..._

Forget just leaving your plants stuck in one place! The Legs Day Project: Plant Edition is giving them the "stem-ina" to go find their own sunshine. No longer tied down by pots, these botanical beings are on the move, driven by a serious craving for light.
